1. for me sir the whole project, I dont like it because of the type of the project is somehow monolithic way because we are 
tied in MVC pattern(I am fan of mvc a quite back and built some html extension about it like the datatable actually it featured in there site.
https://github.com/dadotnetkid/HtmlExtensions.NetCore).
2. I would suggest blazor because it is new? not really because on how it interract between pages it is like webform that stateful can pass event 
through pages and lot of awesome , its like par with some spa js framework like angular,react and vue 
3. About architecture we should try to use if posible the clean architecture, domain, application, core.
3.1 also CQRS since payroll is somehow process hungry system we just call events just not to block thread.
3.2 also event driven archi not really used to but I think it is good for this type of system
4. about dtos and validation we should try to look other like automapper, fluent validation its a cool stuff
5. about UI not really a UI dev but I would suggest admin lte for the win because of side nav hehe
