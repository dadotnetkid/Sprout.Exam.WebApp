1. I would suggest blazor because it is new? not really because on how it interract between pages it is like webform that stateful can pass event 
through pages and lot of awesome , its like par with some spa js framework like angular,react and vue , and also using c# as primary language
2. About architecture we should try to use if posible the clean architecture, domain, application, core.
3 also CQRS since payroll is somehow process hungry system we just call events just not to block thread.
4 also event driven archi not really used to but I think it is good for this type of system
5. about dtos and validation we should try to look other like automapper, fluent validation its a cool stuff
6. about UI not really a UI dev but I would suggest admin lte for the win because of side nav hehe
